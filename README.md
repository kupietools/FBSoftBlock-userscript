# FBSoftBlock-userscript
Silently, invisibly, and reversibly block people on Facebook

FBSoftBlock functions almost exactly like blocking someone, except they never know you blocked them. You remain friends, they can see whatever posts your privileges allow, but the userscript silently scrubs their entire existence from your Facebook experience. You'll never see or hear anything from them again, unless you decided to remove them from this script or turn the script off.

FBSoftBlock goes great with GreaseMonkey, TamperMonkey, or your favorite monkey or non-monkey browser userscript manager.
