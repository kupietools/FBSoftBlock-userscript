# FBSoftBlock-userscript
Silently, invisibly, and reversibly block people on Facebook

FBSoftBlock functions almost exactly like blocking someone, except they never know you blocked them, and you can unblock them and your relationship is still whatever it was previously, unlike real blocking which also unfriends them. You remain friends, they can see whatever posts your privileges allow, but the userscript silently scrubs their entire existence from your Facebook experience. You'll never see or hear anything from them again, unless you decided to remove them from this script or turn the script off. Perfect for that family member or childhood friend whose political views you're sick of hearing, but don't want to unfriend because that's just going to be more unpleasant fuel for the fire when you see them next time you visit home. 

FBSoftBlock goes great with GreaseMonkey, TamperMonkey, or your favorite monkey or non-monkey browser userscript manager.
